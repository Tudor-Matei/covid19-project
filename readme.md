# Covid-19 High School Project

I have made this project for obtaining the Computer Science Certificate awarded at the end of high-school. It is a presentation about important information known at that time about the SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

The project is online at http://atestat-covid-19.glitch.me/
